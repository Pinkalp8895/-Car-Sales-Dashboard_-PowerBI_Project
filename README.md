# Car-Sales-Dashboard_-PowerBI_Project

Description: The data was given to track and analyze the sales performance of a car dealership company that sells different models of cars. So, the data was about customer name, income, gender, dealer name, company, model, engine, transmission, color, price, body style, etc.

Technology: Data Visualization Tool – Microsoft PowerBI

Responsibilities: First, I had to transform the data in PowerBI to perform data cleaning. I have removed null, and duplicates and corrected the data types. Then, I started creating a dashboard. On the Overview tab, I have 3 KPIs showing YTD total sales, YTD average price, and YTD cars sold. Besides that, it also shows the difference between the current and previous year’s sales, price, and cars sold, percentage of growth. Moreover, there are various charts such as area, donut, map, and table showing YTD sales by week, by color, by body style, by dealer’s region, and company-wise sales trend. There is a different filter by body style, dealer name, transmission, and engine. On the Details page, I created a detailed grid that presents all relevant information for each car sale, including car model, body style, color, sales amount, dealer region, date, etc.
